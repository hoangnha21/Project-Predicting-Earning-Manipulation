# Project-Predicting-Earning-Manipulation

## **Objectives:**

* Use sample data (220 cases including 39 manipulators) to develop a logistic regression model that can be used by MCA Technologies Private Limited for predicting probability of earnings manipulation.

* Evaluate the performance of your logistic regression model? How does your model perform on the training and test datasets?

* Develop a decision tree model.

* Develop a logistic regression model using the complete data set (1200 non-manipulators and 39 manipulators), and compare the results with the previous logistic regression model.
